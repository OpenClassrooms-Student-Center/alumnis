description:
    I am a freelance fiction writer, editor and audiobook narrator.
    I write because I love it and to contribute a message of social justice
    and better representation of minorities in media.
    I'm learning to code because I enjoy the intellectual challenge of developing
    applications, software and everything else in between.
    I chose Python for a fresh and exciting gateway to new opportunities.
